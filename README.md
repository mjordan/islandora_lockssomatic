Islandora LOCKSS-O-Matic
========================

A module that allows and Islandora instance to deposit content into a Private LOCKSS Network managed by [LOCKSS-O-Matic](https://github.com/mjordan/lockss-o-matic).

Using a simple implementation of the [SWORD](http://swordapp.org/) protocol, this module notifies LOCKSS-O-Matic that new content is available to have harvested into a [Private LOCKSS Network](http://www.lockss.org/community/networks/). Currently only content that is packaged using the [BagIt](https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt) specification can be deposited.

Still in very early stages of development.
